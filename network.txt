BlockMesh - an universal blockchain backbone

nodes should use 521r1 keys
while clients should use 384r1


start with 6 nodes publishing every 5minutes => turnover 30minutes
then augment to 10 nodes publishing every 1minute => turnover 10minutes


the blockchain will be relayed through API services and website,
all of which using a cluster of replicated CassandraDBs


for access to the nodes from the clients, the main website would have the url's: N#.website.com

maybe in the long run, each entity of each ressource would get a certificate to authenticate himself to the nodes

UPDATES
• allow multiple authorities in the future (=> support for "" and [] field)
• take into account resources' status: each worker's db would keep a record [resource]:[active/inactive], and they would first check if a particular resource is active before verifying the resource.entity pair
• limit block size or make it so a worker broadcasts the hash even before having completed the block creation
  (or revert back to the simplified block idea)
