these blockchains we're creating are all dumb blockchains:
a tx is sent to the network, its signature is verified, contents are verified (enough balance,...),...

however we should also turn to smart blockchains: made up of smart contracts
those contracts are dynamically triggered by the network itself each time the conditions are met

example of smart contracts:
salaries: "every 1st of each month a transaction would be automatically made, discounting the salary of a worker and sending it directly to this worker"
securities future: "if X happens then execute transaction T"

that kind of blockchain needs a more than active network, where nodes are keeping tabs on previous contracts and acting uppon events
they therefore need shared symbolic definitions and additionnal power


We can extend the use of blockchain for, digital or physical, goods ownership:
the blockchain would keep identities of people (which could be anonymous),
records representing the goods with all the required identification and proof of ownership/existence,
ownership records,
ownership transfer requests,
payment records

should allow multiple owners and modes of shared ownership (for example, requiring only one,a majority or all owners to allow a transfer)
